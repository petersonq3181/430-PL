1.
a. Lisp macros: you can write programs that manipulate parse trees.
Graham explains they are difficult to write in Lisp, but 20-25% of
their code was macros, thererfore concluding that 20-25% of their code
was crucial for their product, and difficult for other companies to write.

b. Lisp is a very high level language. Graham thinks this is synonymous
with its "abstractness", and is competitively crucial because it's also
synonymous with its "power".

c. A social feature of Lisp is that no other start-ups appeared to be
using it, so they had little competition that was using the exact
same technology.


2. 
a. With regards to the continuum of PLs' abstractness (power), Graham
claims that only programmers with knowledge of the most powerful PL can
see the differences in power of all the PLs along the continuum. This is
significant because it applies to understanding in many areas of knowledge.
One cannot know what they don't know; one can only know that which is within
the scope of their current level of knowledge.

b. Graham claims that PLs are not just technology, but what programmers think
in. I find this significant because it seems true based on my own experience.
For example, I never thought about parent-child relationships of things,
inheritance, etc. until I started using OOP in Java.


3.
a. Was the language designed to be easy to use?

b. Is the language controlled by a big company?

c. Do people love the language?
